## Abstract & Background
This project aims to train a predictive model for identifying fraudulent transactions in e-commerce platforms. With the rapid growth of e-Commerce, online fraud has become a significant challenge to both businesses and customers, causing financial losses to both parties.

By analyzing the dataset "Fraudulent E-Commerce Transaction" using Python and Jupyter Notebook with ML libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, I have built and trained a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions. The insights and information extracted in this project can be used in real-time fraud detection systems, which contribute to safer online transactions.
